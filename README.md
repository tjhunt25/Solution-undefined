# Project 2

https://solution-undefined.herokuapp.com/

** The objective of this project is: **
- To pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
- To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

** CORE REQUIREMENTS **
-Make sure to do all of the following with your app:

- Models. Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are associated correctly! If you didn't get to try a many-to-many association in your last project (i.e. for likes/faves, shortlist of items, users following/friending other users, etc) this might be a good chance to try out that more challenging database structure.
- Views. Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
- Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. - Validate sign up information, verify valid (and unique) email addresses, and secure passwords.
Use Gems. Use a GEM to add extra functionality to your app.
- Use AJAX. Make AJAX requests to handle any interactions with your own server that should happen transparently, i.e. without a page reload (such as liking/favouriting a post, adding tags, autocomplete-based search, etc).
- User Login. Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up. Ensure that users cannot edit the items created by other users, and that general users cannot access admin-only features!
- Heroku. Deploy your code to Heroku.

#### ** Solution Undefined: **

Our project is a coding challenge sandbox similar to codewars, where users respond to challenges by writing a solution in the browser. Users can also define a challenge for others to answer.

To do this we need to find a way to write and test code in the browser, save it for re-loading and editing and 'rate' it in some manner to evaluate how the user performed.

** current features: **

- User sign up and log in.
- challenge posting
- solution posting
- codemirror code editor for solutions
